    "Often, image data can be fed in as raw data to deep learning models and requires less feature engineering than other type of data. Thus, in many cases you would **not** need need to store image data as a feature group in the feature store, but rather you would save it directly as a training dataset in for example .tfrecords format.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes you want to join image features with other types of features and you might also need to do feature engineering steps such as *data augmentation, image scaling, image normalization etc.*. This notebook will show you how you can save image data as a feature group in the feature store."
